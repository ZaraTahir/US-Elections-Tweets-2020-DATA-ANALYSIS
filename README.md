# US-Elections-Tweets-2020-DATA-ANALYSIS
**Data Understanding and Exploratory Data Analysis**

This project focuses on analyzing a Twitter dataset related to the US Election 2020. The dataset, collected using the Twitter API, contains various attributes such as tweet text, likes, retweets, user information, and location data. The goal of this project is to gain valuable insights from this dataset, with a three-fold approach.

retweets, user information, and location data. The primary objective of this project is to extract valuable insights from the dataset.
**Project Phases:**

**Data Pre-processing and Exploration**

In this phase, we focused on data pre-processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Key tasks included modifying data types, handling missing values, and performing text data preprocessing. We conducted sentiment analysis to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. Additionally, we analyzed tweets on a candidate-wise and location-wise basis, using visualizations to convey our findings effectively.

**Clustering and Frequent Pattern Mining**

The second phase involved clustering and frequent pattern mining. We clustered tweets based on geographical locations and the sources/utilities used for posting tweets. We utilized clustering algorithms such as K-means for location clustering. Frequent pattern mining was applied to discover common patterns in the dataset, including hashtags and mentions.

**Final Report**

In the final phase, we compiled our findings into a comprehensive report. This report encompasses a summary of key insights, detailed visualizations, recommendations, and possibilities for future work. We provided an explanation of the methodologies employed throughout the project and drew conclusions from our analysis.

**Note**
